Iâ€™m a software development engineer with 4-years experience using Object-Oriented Programming languages and patterns to fix issues in a complex codebase and release new features. More recently, I have started leading small groups of engineers through the software development life cycle (SDLC). I spend my free time learning about software architecture, computer networks, and preparing for Azure certifications.
