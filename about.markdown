My experience as a Software Development Engineer includes using programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, and Python, as well as frameworks like .NET and React. I have also gained expertise in leading other software engineers through the software development life cycle, fixing open issues, and deploying new features using distributed computing and micro-services.  My most advanced database skills are with SQL, but I have working knowledge of MongoDB.  I am currently working towards my first AWS certification.
