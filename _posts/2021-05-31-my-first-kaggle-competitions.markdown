Over the weekend, I joined two popular knowledge competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic){:target="_blank"} and [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer){:target="_blank"}.

I was very familiar with the first one, since I had implemented the CART algorithm in college and used this competition's dataset to compare my implementation's performance with that of [scikit-learn Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html?highlight=cart).  The second competition caught my eye because of its use of the famous MNIST dataset.

I'm really excited about the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} environment offered by Kaggle.  Here are my notebooks for these competitions:

- [Titanic Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/am3z0la/notebook75247a24a1){:target="_blank"}
- [Digit Recognizer Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/am3z0la/notebook00f3e4d495-classification-tree){:target="_blank"}
