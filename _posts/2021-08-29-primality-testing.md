Explored the mathematical formulation of the Miller-Rabin primality test for compositeness and used Python to implement it along with its supporting concepts. Compared the performance of the Miller-Rabin test with a support vector machine binary classiÔ¨Åer from scikit-learn. Implemented the Miller-Rabin test as an Angular 2 web application in order to showcase it during a 15-minute presentation.
